### <strong>Description</strong>

This project is an introduction to computer security. Snow Crash will make you discover security in various sub-domains, with a developer-oriented approach. You will become familiar with several languages (ASM/perl/php…), develop a certain logic to understand unknown programs, and become aware of problems linked to simple programming errors

> *Project en collaboration avec <a href="https://github.com/nemu69">Nemuel Page Léonie</a> (<a href="https://profile.intra.42.fr/users/nepage-l">nepage-l</a>).*
